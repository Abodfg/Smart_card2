The AI engineer successfully built the Abod Card Telegram bot from inception, focusing on digital product sales and management. The initial phase established a full-stack architecture (React, FastAPI, MongoDB) and integrated with the Telegram Bot API, developing both user and admin functionalities. Iterative development included addressing bugs (CORS, button malfunctions, callback handling) and expanding features like various delivery types (code, phone, email, ID, manual). Significant effort was put into backend data models, API endpoints, bot logic, and an admin dashboard. Recent work centered on enhancing user bot UI/UX, adding a robust user banning system, comprehensive admin notification management (including dual admin roles and system heartbeat), and creating detailed admin guides. The latest major task involves transitioning the user store interface to an aesthetic and highly responsive Telegram Web App, with a reported issue regarding product purchases in this new interface. The user emphasizes unparalleled creativity, visual identity, and fixing the purchase bug.

<code_architecture>

- ****: The central FastAPI backend. It manages all Telegram bot logic, including user and admin interactions, database operations (products, categories, users, orders, codes), session management for conversational flow, and business logic for purchases, wallet top-ups, code distribution, order fulfillment, and notifications. It was heavily modified for delivery types, callback handling, UI/UX refinements (animations, menu), admin features (user management, product/category management), and notification systems.
- ****: A new configuration file to externalize and easily manage special offers and daily surprises.
- ** files (offers_README.md, DAILY_SURPRISES_GUIDE.md, DATABASE_QUICK_REFERENCE.md, TEXT_EDITING_GUIDE.md, ADMIN_NOTIFICATIONS_GUIDE.md)**: These are comprehensive documentation files created by the AI to guide administrators on how to manage specific aspects of the bot, such as editing offers, understanding the database, modifying texts, and understanding the notification system.
- ****: An initial static HTML file provided by the user for the store interface, intended for Telegram Web App integration.
- ****: The new HTML file created for the enhanced, creative Telegram Web App, which is now the primary focus for the user store interface.
- ****: The main React component for the web administration dashboard. It displays statistics, manages products, categories, codes, and orders, integrating with the FastAPI backend.
- ****: A top-level, comprehensive guide for overall administration of the Abod Card system.
- ****: Instructions generated for the user on how to restart the system after a shutdown.
- ****: A document outlining various options for integrating the store interface, particularly concerning URL handling.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with a major overhaul of the user-facing store interface. The user provided an initial HTML structure () and explicitly requested its integration as a Telegram Web App, with a strong emphasis on advanced UI/UX, aesthetics, responsiveness, and a complete visual identity for Abod Store (branding, logo, colors).

The AI initiated this by:
1.  Creating a new HTML file, , which is intended to house the redesigned and creatively enhanced Telegram Web App for the store.
2.  Modifying  to add new API endpoints ( and ) to serve this Web App and handle purchase requests coming from it.
3.  Updating the  function in  to use  for the Telegram , pointing to the new  endpoint, thereby enabling the Telegram Web App experience.
4.  Adding necessary imports like  to .
5.  Refactoring aspects of  and  to leverage Telegram Web App's capabilities for a more secure and integrated user experience, including automatic user ID validation via .
6.  Creating  to explain different approaches for linking the store, given the user's preference against direct Emergent URLs.

The user tested the new interface and reported that product purchases are not working (). The AI engineer's current focus is to continue the creative development of this Web App, addressing the design and visual identity, and crucially, resolving the reported purchase failure.

The AI engineer progressed the Abod Card Telegram bot through several critical phases. Initially, the focus was on a Telegram Web App (), incorporating visual identity and fixing a purchase bug. A major pivot integrated Telegram Stars with Ammer Pay for all transactions, including backend models and UI adjustments. This was followed by extensive debugging of frontend JavaScript, bot responsiveness, and implementing an admin order search. Critically, the user then requested a full reversion to a local dollar wallet payment system, citing issues with Stars, while maintaining Stars code for future use. Concurrently, the user demanded a fully functional, aesthetically pleasing website for  (not a redirect), a multi-language system, enhanced admin-managed payment methods, and user bot search. The last actions involved addressing bot unresponsiveness and starting to build a dedicated full store HTML for the user's website, directly confronting the redirect issue and aiming for a unique UI.

<product_requirements>
The Abod Card is a Telegram bot designed to sell digital cards. Users require a modern, aesthetic, and responsive Telegram Web App () as the primary interface, displaying products under categorized sections (Games, Digital Gift Cards, E-commerce, Digital Subscriptions). Key features include a functional purchase flow, detailed order history, and fully operational user-facing buttons. Branding must be consistent with Abod Card name, a specific logo, and matching color scheme across the bot and web interface. Originally, the payment system transitioned to Telegram Stars via Ammer Pay with admin Stars management. However, this was reverted to a local dollar wallet system, with admin-managed manual payment methods. The user now desires a full, creative, and aesthetically unique website at  that functions as a complete store (not a redirect) and integrates with the bot to recognize user IDs. Additional features requested include multi-language support (Arabic/English), unique order numbers with admin search capabilities, and product/category search in the user bot.

<code_architecture>

- ****: The core FastAPI backend.
    - **Summary of importance:** Manages bot logic, API endpoints, MongoDB interactions for products, categories, users, orders, and payments.
    - **Summary of changes:** Extensively modified for: Web App API endpoints (, ),  integration, purchase flow fixes (ID input, error handling), MongoDB serialization, admin notifications, category management. Underwent major shifts from initial purchase flow fixes to full Telegram Stars/Ammer Pay integration (models ,  ), and then a full reversion to a local dollar wallet system, removing Stars logic and integrating admin-managed  model. New  generation, admin order search (), and health check endpoints (, , ) were added. Branding text (Abod Store to Abod Card) and specific forbidden words were removed.
- ****: The user-facing Telegram Web App.
    - **Summary of importance:** Main interactive store interface for users, crucial for aesthetics and functionality.
    - **Summary of changes:** Numerous redesigns for visual identity (logo, color scheme to match Abod Card theme), fixing button functionality, dynamic display of product categories. Adapted for displaying prices and wallet balances, initially in Telegram Stars, then reverted to US Dollars. Implemented an elegant input modal for delivery types (like ), fixed JavaScript errors (e.g., duplicate  variable, product loading issues), and improved out of balance messaging.
- ****: React component for the admin dashboard.
    - **Summary of importance:** Its routing configuration caused initial conflicts with Web App endpoints.
    - **Summary of changes:** No direct code changes were explicitly logged in the trajectory, but its influence on routing was a key early consideration.
- ****: Used for internal testing logs and problem statements.
    - **Summary of importance:** Critical for tracking issues, test outcomes, and guiding the AI's development.
    - **Summary of changes:** Regularly updated with test results and problem diagnoses throughout the development cycle.
- **New Deployment/Domain Files**: , , ,  were created for general deployment. Specific HTML files for domain linking (, , , , , ) were generated to address user's domain hosting needs.  was newly created to address the user's demand for a full store UI.

<pending_tasks>
- Fully implement multi-language support (English portion).
- Implement product and category search functionality within the user bot.
- Ensure the admin interface for managing manual payment methods is fully functional and supports adding name, account number, and terms.
- Integrate the newly created  into the user's domain  and ensure it functions as a full store, not a redirect.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing several critical user complaints. The user reported that their custom domain  was merely redirecting to the Telegram Web App, instead of hosting a full, integrated store. Furthermore, both the user and admin Telegram bots were reported as unresponsive. The user also reiterated a demand for a unique, creative, and aesthetically pleasing website interface that matches the provided logo.

In response, the AI engineer first confirmed the user bot's responsiveness by restarting the backend and verifying it could send messages. Then, to tackle the website UI challenge, the AI analyzed the provided logo again to ensure design consistency and proceeded to create a new file, , which is intended to be a full, standalone store interface for the user's website, moving away from the previous redirect approach. The trajectory ends with this file creation.
